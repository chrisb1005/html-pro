<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>Welcome to the story of Tony. Tony was a big time drug dealer in the bronx area of new york. tony wasnt a stand up guy. He put a hit out on his own guy, tye, just for a brick of cocaine. said he was in the way and stuff like that. A added bonus was that tye was messing around with his old girl. On the inside, tony was jealous of tye. They both had hood dreams. Tye was just acheiving his quicker than tony.</p>
<p>Tony shows up to tye's funneral and consoles tye's mother and gives his condolences. The whole time, tony is feeling like a whore in church. He even tried to pick up the shovel and bury tye faster. The next week tony is in the mall, flexing. New jewlery, girls on his arm, money in his pocket, all that. All of a sudden, here comes paul, tye's cousin. He cant believe what he see's because just last week, paul asked tony for some money and tony couldn't do it.</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>This breeds jealousy in paul for tony. Paul see's what has happened and knows, the only reason tony has all this money is because he robbed and killed his cousin. Paul now wants to kill tony but cant right now because it's not the right time. So paul waits for the right moment. A couple months pass by and paul decides to go out to the club for a good time. When he shows up, he see's one of the girls that tony was with in the mall. he decides to talk to her and see whats going on.</p>
<p>Long story short, paul ends up leaving with one of the girls. They end up doing what grown folks do and the girl goes to sleep. Paul is still up and reaches for her phone, starts going through it. He finds the messages from tony and finds out where tony lives at. Perfect. A couple weeks later paul shows up where tony lives. </p>

<h3>Ending</h3>
<p>Paul is in the car waiting. He spots tony and gets out, hood on, gun cocked. He walks up to the car and says, "Whats poppin?". Tony is caught slipping, his gun in his glove box, too far to reach for before being shot. Tony says &quotWhats up dog, you still need that work you asked for?&quot. Tony reaches for the drugs and tries to give it to paul. Paul just smiles and empties his whole clip into tony. End of tony. End of story.</p></body>
